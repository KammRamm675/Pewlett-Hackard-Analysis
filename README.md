# Riding Out the Silver Tsunami

## Purpose of this Analysis

  -	The purpose of this analysis to bring to light a massive loss of personnel due to retirement.  Along with this analysis questions will be answered regarding strategy in handling the losses in terms of recuperating from them. 

## Major Points About the Impending Wave

  -	Firstly, the amount of people retiring is staggering and very alarming.  Roughly 72,458 members will be retiring with NO ONE to replace them.  There should have been a plan put in place to mitigate such situations.  Please refer to this hyperlink for raw data containing ID number, Names, and tiles for those retiring:

  -	Secondly, a question begged to be asked.  “What type of employee are we losing?” Out of the 72,458 members being lost we are going to be losing members from 7 types of titles, most of which being leadership toles. Please see picture “NAME” below:

  -	Thirdly, referring to the above picture, 70% of the people retiring is that from leadership.  In my experience GOOD leadership is hard to come by in small numbers let alone over 50,000 members.  So, to me, this might be a foreshadow in significant loss in productivity due to lack of experienced leaders and loss of trust between new hire leaders and long-time workers.  I would suggest implementing a program to quell cohesion resistance. (Pizza parties won’t work) 

  -	Fourth and final point.  Concerning the “manager” position we currently stand at 24 and losing 2.  This isn’t as bad as compared to “Senior Engineer” and “Senior Staff” which are losing nearly or just 25% of their work force.  This only provided as a micro-scale view of losses. 

## Summary
  
  -	There are two questions I would like to address in my summary. 

    1.	How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 
          Not considering losses we currently stand at 24 Managers, 15,128 Assistant Engineers, 15,159 Technique Leaders, 107,391 Staff, 115,003 Engineers, 95,853 Senior Staff,           and 97,750 Senior Engineers.  Referencing the above picture, we can see the impact very easily.  After all retirees are considered, we have the following left:

          Senior Engineer - 71,834
          Senior Staff - 70,927
          Engineer - 105,718
          Staff - 99,755
          Technique Leader  - 11,556
          Assistant Engineer -  14,038
          Manager - 22  

          It does depend on how you look at it.  From the eyes of a new hire there plenty of work knowledge still on site to help with teaching and indoctrination. From the               point of view of management one might think there’s not enough management to control administrative duties. 


    2.	 Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

          Please reference the table provided in the link. https://github.com/KammRamm675/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_titles.csv To put it           plainly, no.  After the “tsunami” we will have the above numbers left.  If we focused on one titles we can see why.  Let’s choose the biggest number of qualified                 mentors, Staff with 579 qualified members.  With 99,755 member total and 579 qualified we are left with 99,176 unqualified members needing mentoring.  In a nutshell,             we are left with 172 people being mentored by 1 qualified member.  I personally couldn’t imagine mentoring more that 25-30.  And these are numbers not counting new               hires to backfill the losses from the “silver tsunami.”
